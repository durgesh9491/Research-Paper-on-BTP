\begin{abstract}
In this work, a mathematical model has been developed to analyze the spread of a distributed attack on critically targeted resources in a network using firewall security coefficient. The model provides an epidemic framework with two sub-frameworks to consider the difference between the overall behavior of the attacking population and the targeted population. The targeted population and attacking population  is divided into five compartments of nodes, viz. Susceptible - Latent - Breaking out - Recovered- Antidotal. With cyber mass action incidence, the boundedness of the system, the feasibility of equilibrium states and their stabilities are analyzed. Basic reproduction number ${{\cal R}}_{0}$ is calculated and it is observed that when ${{\cal R}}_{0}<1$, then the system will have malicious code free stable steady state. Again, when ${{\cal R}}_{0}>1$, then endemic steady state exists and will be locally asymptotically stable. The impact of firewall security rule base in controlling transmission of malicious objects is analyzed. Many researchers investigated the impact of media awareness in biological disease spread using mathematical modeling used transmission coefficient function of the form $\beta(I)=\beta e^{-m\frac{I}{N}}$ and established that multiple positive equilibria are possible when the media effect is sufficiently strong \cite{cui2008impact,liu2008impact,sahu2012,sahu2015dynamics}. Similarly we are taking firewall security as a media coverage factor in our computer network model of malicious code propagation. The coefficient of firewall security m depends on the types of files under consideration, defined firewall security rules (education, awareness, responsiveness, economy, etc.) in the firewall rule base and the reliability and efficiency of the firewall. We propose a method for quantifying the coefficient m of firewall security as :
          $$m=-{\log_e (p+q-pq)},$$
where, q quantifies the response of the files to the defined security rules. It is assumed that the malware propagation rate can be reduced by p fraction when all received files follow the defined security rules.
Asymptotic local stability method is used as an alternate to find the stability of the system. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the system parameters for basic reproduction number and endemic equilibrium points has been carried out using normalized forward sensitivity index. Numerical experimentation has been carried out to simulate the system of equations in support of analytical findings.

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this

% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
